    <p>My favorite coffee beverage is a white chocolate mocha from Starbucks, either hot or iced, depending on my mood or the weather.
         <br>I usually order it with cold foam because it adds a smooth, creamy texture that makes the drink feel more refreshing and enjoyable. 
         <br>It has the perfect balance of sweetness and coffee flavor.I like having one when I’m working on assignments or creative projects 
         <br>because it helps me stay focused, productive, and in a good mindset while I work.</p>
